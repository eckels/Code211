          <p class="desc">Don’t know what you want to build for Code211? In this workshop you will be brainstorming different ideas for your project that you want to build at the Hackathon. This is going to be an idea generating activity, where people will find problems and design creative solutions to solve them. You will also meet other people who may be interested in your idea/solution, or you even may find other projects that pique your interest that you may want to join. This is intended to be a way to help you find a group if you need one, and also to find problems worth solving using Computer Science.</p>

This will build upon our past knowledge by using external libraries.<br><br>This workshop is at a beginner level and you are not expected to have any Python experience. The bots are simply a means to an end, a way for you to get started programming. Who knows, after this workshop, maybe you could go on to win Code211. There will be a 10 minute initial set up period. We recommend having the newest version of Python installed at the least along with a text editor.</p>
